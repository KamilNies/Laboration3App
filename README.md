Copy paste whatever path you want to test into the "GetByteArrayFromPath(path)" method on line 23 with the string path(s) found between line 15 and 19 as the argument. Alternatively, import a custom image file into the project solution and create a new path towards it. 

# Laboration3App Edit

I've added a Console.Write("Input file path to image: ") instead and commented out the file paths in program. Now you need to manually type the file path in the console or simply copy past the correct file path. I've also made some minor changes to the outputted size chunks. The chunks that are listed now should have thir size offset by 12 bytes, yielding the correct chunk size.
